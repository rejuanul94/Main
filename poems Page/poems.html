        Here's a short english poem and obviously i am the poet of this - 
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="pt1"> The Love Kid Has Grown Up </h3>
        <br>
        	Once there was a kid, <br>
		Forbidden by every did. <br>
		Sports seemed impossible for him, <br>
		Loved to watch chotta bheem. <br>
	<br>
		Genious his name for elders, <br>
		Odds catch him out the shelters. <br>
		Curious, he wanted to be, <br>
		A bit break had shattered the tree. <br>
	<br>	
		Once in seven, a little braven, <br>
		To his surprise, met a haven. <br>
		Scented haven, blossoms lying, <br>
		The haven made his blood flying. <br>
	<br>
		Gentle haven grabbed the blood, <br>
		And as waves in a flood, <br>
		Moments came happy and sad - <br>
	<br>
		The happy ones for six months, <br>
		The sad ones forever. <br>
		The happy ones, the destroyer, <br>
		The sad ones the saver. <br>
	<br>
		The flying haven came and lost, <br>
		The love kid went in a frost. <br>
		The frozen kid lost in tears, <br>
		The teary days went for years. <br>
	<br>
		After years, The kid was gone, <br>
		Returned visiting views and lawn. <br>
	<br>
		Now a days, people say - <br>
		Once the love kid fell in love. <br>
		Now a days, people say- <br>
		The love kid has grown up. <br>

		Here's another one . hope you will enjoy -
     	<br>
      	<br>
		<h3 class="pt2"> What does a man need ? </h3>
	<br>
		The only things which needs a man. <br>
		Money, friends and a woman . <br>
		Like the shores making reeds, <br>
		These are man's basic needs . <br>
	<br>
		Smoking, travel and sport habits,<br>
		Makes a mans basic needs.<br>
		These needs are like the wings, <br>
		Supporting the bees with the swings. <br>
	<br>
		Hair, packs and inky deeds, <br>
		Makes a man's flexing needs. <br>
		Like a designer designs a book, <br>
		These things boosts a mans look. <br>
	<br>
		Love, fights and adult greeds, <br>
		Builts a man's moodic needs. <br>
		Like the roses, spreading scents, <br>
		These act as inner fragrance. <br>
	<br>
		These things differ in man to man, <br>
		But the common thing isn't woman. <br>
		Like the Apis makes honey, <br>
		Men loves to Make money.<br>

			<h3 class="pt2">  For You !</h3>
		<br>
			The Flowers of an Yellow tree <br> 
			I heard it's a Blossom ,<br>
			It bloomed in the mighty spring<br>
			It shines and makes all free.<br>
		<br>
			The flower that i thought of<br>
			Has a Hearty scent like you,<br>
			Seems ever you crossed the tree<br>
			And made the flower free.<br>
		<br>
			You belong to some distant lands,<br>
			Some miles far from me.<br>
			Ever if i stare the nights,<br>
			The Stars you seem to be.<br>
		<br>
			You visit in my deadly dreams,<br>
			In the castle of my heart.<br>
			The Princess of my castle you are,<br>
			And i'm your Princy Bird.<br>

      		<br>
			What was that? When eggs hatched,<br>
			The warmth they got from you.<br>
			Isn't now the clouds cry, For the<br>
			herbs to smile. Where has that shadow tree gone?<br>
			Hasn't it remembered me?<br>
			Or had after the springs, it got <br>
			A New Plant to nurture. Isn't this true?<br>
		<br>
			The hopes I saw, In the eggs i lived,<br>
			In the herbs i were, In the shadows i been;<br>
			Some rubbish i ever thought of; The faint<br>
			days of Peace has passed by!<br>
			Couldn't you see me, vanishing in these<br>
			wild storms; Where had your eyes been lost.<br>
		<br>
			Those frosty days i went by,<br>
			With the little sunshine you gave me;<br>
			Is lost Now!" No hopes i see,<br>
			In this era of tug-of-war;<br>
			If ever I hoped for; Got nothing,<br>
			But noone to take on these; The Cuts.<br>
		<br>
			The Cuts, i felt - hasn't ever healed ;<br>
			Hpoe so not ever heal. As,<br>
			In this era of tug-of-war,<br>
			I'm nowhere to be found in ur sight.<br>
		<br>
			And that's enough for a bloody stranger ;<br>
			Who always hopes for something new and better.<br>
			And that's enough for me.<br>

      		<br>
			The statue of a golden heart,<br>
			Is based in the jungle.<br>
			The jungle at amountain top,<br>
			And stones as it's shingle.<br>
		<br>
			The Snakes, falls and Mighty trees,<br>
			The roots of whose could make a bridge;<br>
			The bees tease and make us feel,<br>
			How could some one be to jungle.<br>
		<br>
			The melodies of a pleasant fall,<br>
			The flies, bats and leach would call;<br>
			The Marsh winds of shrubs and herbs,<br>
			With water having lots of serbs.<br>
		<br>
			The Bambbos of as tall asa you,<br>
			A small boy with age of few;<br>
			His paths to reach the top,<br>
			No sweat makes him to stop.<br>
		<br>
			The way you feel, you can't explain,<br>
			The pain you get can't give you pain.<br>
			You see the sky as in your hand,<br>
			The down seems like grains of sand.<br>
		<br>
			If ever have to free your mind,<br>
			Ask it some thing to rewind;<br>
			Give a tingle and ask the fact,<br>
			Have you ever been to jungle?<br>

			Falling the fellow, for a fellow!<br>

			But, What the cry for?<br>
		<br>	
			Is that he drowned in grief,<br>
